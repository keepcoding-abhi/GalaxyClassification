# GalaxyClassification
A transfer learning based approach to classify galaxies based on their morphology.

GalaxyClassificationTL.ipynb : contains the code which implements 5 different transfer learning models based on VGG-16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, and DenseNet121.

GalaxyImageAnalysis.ipynb : prints the images of different galaxies and shows the images before and after performing the pre-processing steps.

CNNsFromScratch.ipynb : trains LeNet-5, MiniVGG, AlexNet, SimpleNet and SqueezeNet from scratch on the given dataset

ConventionalMLClassifiers.ipynb : uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and traditional classifiers like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Randomized Tree for classification
